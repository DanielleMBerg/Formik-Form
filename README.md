# Formik-Form
A basic form that asks for two inputs: email and password. It validates if those fields are filled and if the email address has proper formatting.

The basics of the code was provided to me by my MIT course. I wrote the code in the App.js file.

# How to Run
To run on your own device, download all the files (except for the and the README file) and save them in one folder. Then complete the following steps:

Open a command line on your computer and run the command cd path/to/project/root, which allows you to point to the root folder of the starter files (note that path/to/project/root should be replaced with the actual path to the starter files)

Within the same command-line window, run npm install to install all dependencies

Once the command completes successfully, run npm start to start the application in your browser.

Now you should be able to view the form live!
